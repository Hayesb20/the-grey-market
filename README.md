It is very hard to find reliable data about the prices of items around you. Mnay sources can very and often times leads us to 
over pay for things that we did not need to overpay for. The Grey Market program is intended to be used as a place where you 
can store information about products and their prices so that you can access that data anytime and from anywhere to compare it 
against an item that you are thinking of purchasing to ensure that you are not overpaying and get the best deal possible.
